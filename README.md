## üìù Solution Background

Project Managers often spend significant time manually preparing weekly Project Status Reports (PSRs), leading to inconsistent formats, delays, and redundant work‚Äîeven when project data is already available in centralized repositories like Virtuoso. PM Ops Copilot Agent automates PSR generation, enabling standardized, timely, and efficient reporting with minimal manual intervention.[PM Ops Copilot Agent.pptx](https://github.com/nitjain/PMOpsAgent/blob/431140e8990b5ca98c557283030c447e20560ebd/Assets%20%26%20Artifacts/PM%20Ops%20Copilot%20Agent.pptx)
